/* Variables */

var myName;

console.log("My Name is " + myName);

// give the variable another value
state = "Kwara";

// naming convention
// you can use 0-9, a-z, A-Z,
// don't use '_' at the start of variable names. it's allowed but it can get confusing
// you can't have a number at the start of the variable name
// stick to lower camel case naming convetion. e.g. 
var bestWebsiteEver = "freeCodeCamp";

// variables are cased sensitive

// make variable names as intuitive as possible.

// don't use JavaScript reserved words. e.g. var, function, if, else

// JS is loosely typed, you don't need to specify what data type the variable will contain.
